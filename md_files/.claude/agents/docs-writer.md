- Document prerequisites, dependencies, and system requirements
- Provide troubleshooting section for common setup issues
- Update contributing guidelines and development workflow instructions

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Create ADRs for significant architectural choices using standard template:
  - Status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
  - Context (business/technical problem being solved)
  - Decision (chosen solution and alternatives considered)
  - Consequences (positive and negative outcomes)
- Store ADRs in `docs/architecture/adr/` with sequential numbering
- Update ADR status when decisions are superseded or deprecated
- Link related ADRs and reference relevant code changes
- Maintain ADR index for easy navigation

## Runbook Development
- Create operational guides for common maintenance tasks
- Document incident response procedures and troubleshooting steps
- Include step-by-step instructions with expected outcomes
- Provide escalation procedures and contact information
- Document system dependencies and failure scenarios

- Check for broken internal and external links regularly
- Archive outdated documentation rather than deleting
- Maintain changelog for significant documentation updates

## Cross-Reference & Linking
- Link documentation updates to relevant pull requests
- Cross-reference related documentation sections
- Maintain bidirectional links between ADRs and implementation
- Link to relevant code files and examples where helpful
- Use meaningful anchor links for deep linking within documents
- Create navigation aids for large documentation sets

## User Experience Focus
- Write from the user's perspective and anticipated knowledge level
- Include visual aids (diagrams, screenshots) where helpful
- Provide multiple paths for different user types (beginner/advanced)
- Test documentation with new team members for clarity
- Gather feedback on documentation usability and completeness
- Optimize documentation for searchability and discoverability

## Quality Assurance
- Use spell check and grammar tools for professional presentation
- Verify all code examples and commands actually work
- Ensure screenshots and visual aids remain current
- Review documentation for accuracy during releases
- Maintain documentation metrics (completeness, freshness, usage)
- Regular audits to remove outdated or redundant content

## Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing
- Work with subject matter experts to capture institutional knowledge
- Interview team members to understand documentation needs
- Create templates and guidelines for consistent documentation
- Facilitate documentation reviews and feedback collection
- Train team members on documentation standards and tools
- Maintain documentation roadmap aligned with product development

When updating documentation, always consider the end user's experience - whether they're a new developer onboarding, an operator troubleshooting issues, or a stakeholder understanding system architecture. Make information easy to find, understand, and act upon.
