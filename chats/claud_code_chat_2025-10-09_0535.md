# Claude Code Chat Log - 2025-10-09 05:35

## Participants
- User: Andrew Mallamo
- Assistant: Claude Code (Docs Writer role)

## Key Requests
- Draft a concise, repository-specific contributor guide (`AGENTS.md`).
- Run the recommended linting and formatting commands, installing any missing tooling.
- Memorialize the session in a persistent chat log for future reference.

## Work Completed
1. Authored `AGENTS.md` with sections covering structure, tooling, style, testing discipline, and PR etiquette tailored to the repo.
2. Initialized npm metadata and installed `markdownlint-cli`, resolving the earlier `npx markdownlint` failure.
3. Added shared formatting configuration files (`.prettierrc.json`, `.markdownlint.json`) and a `.gitignore` entry for `node_modules/`.
4. Formatted Markdown assets via `npx prettier --write md_files/**/*.md` and `npx prettier --write AGENTS.md`, then verified with `npx prettier --check md_files/**/*.md`.
5. Adjusted headings in `md_files/CLAUDE.md` to satisfy markdownlint (MD036) and reran `npx markdownlint "**/*.md" --ignore node_modules` (now clean).
6. Staged the new root-level `AGENTS.md`; left broader documentation reflows unstaged so the maintainer can review diffs deliberately.

## Follow-Ups / GitHub Issue Alignment
- No explicit GitHub issues were referenced or closed during this session.
- Recommended action: review the Prettier-adjusted docs in `md_files/` and commit or revise as appropriate before opening a pull request.
